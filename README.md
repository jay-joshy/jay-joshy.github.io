## Goals

A resident-led and faculty reviewed website for high-yield and concise information about 1) conditions 2) therapies/medications 3) Clinical decision tools 4) patient resources. It is meant for **practical use by residents**.

Secondary goals if time permits includes:

- Hosting our own LLM with capabilities of searching through allergy guidelines
- Set of questions for RC studying
- Critical appraisal of new research
- Patient resources translated into different languages

## Site structure:

- About - goals of the site, contributors, etc.
- Privacy - boilerplate -- we're not collecting anything
- Contribute - WIP, style guides, etc. Also for shortcode guides.
- Main page -- slideshow, links to click on,
- Research
- Conditions/Topics
- Clinical tools
- Meds
- Patient resources

## Data structures

Some data will be stored as .toml or .json for ease of editing. Most likely we will pursue .toml given it is much more human readable.

### research articles:

Systematic review vs primary evidence

- Metadata
  - Title
  - Year
  - Journal
  - Trial name: Option
- Tags: list[str]
- Summary
- PICO
- Figures
  - (Path to photo, description)
- Description
  - Background
  - Objective
  - Methods
  - Results
  - Limitations
  - Conclusion

### medications:

- Generic
- Brand names
- Cost:: (province and coverage)
- Mechanism of action:
- Doses:
  - Indication, dose, adjustments
- Contraindications:
- Side effects:
  - Severe
  - Common

### macros (for conditions to c/p)

- History
- Investigations:
- Management:

## Topic breakdown

1. list them all out or 2) break them down into sections
   easier to navigate if you break them down into sections
   It might be easier to just list them all out and THEN figure out it later.
   That, or USE the tags to find things more easily
